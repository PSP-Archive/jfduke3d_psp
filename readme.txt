With contributions by Ken Silverman

31 May 2005


This is a work-in-progress release of my port of Duke Nukem 3D using my
ported Build engine codebase. There are bugs which I'm tracking down and
fixing as an ongoing process.

WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!
1. Since this is work-in-progress I cannot and will not attest to the safety
   of using this executable. You use it at your own risk!
2. 3D Realms and Apogee do not support this port. Contact me at
   jonof@edgenetwk.com if you find problems.
WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!

*** READ  releasenotes.html  FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE NEW
*** THINGS IN THIS VERSION.




Enjoy!

    MAKEFILE PROJECT : jfduke3d_psp Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this jfduke3d_psp project for you.  

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your jfduke3d_psp project.


jfduke3d_psp.vcproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

This project allows you to build/clean/rebuild from within Visual Studio by calling the commands you have input 
in the wizard. The build command can be nmake or any other tool you use.

This project does not contain any files, so there are none displayed in Solution Explorer.
