<p align="center"><u><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">Version 3.1</font></strong></u></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">New or Updated Features</font></strong> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Support for renaming the embedded files within
    a group file.</font>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The program can now read the names.h file (you
    specify one to read in the program options). As a result, the names for the
    various art tiles are shown in the art file information view.</font>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">New right click menu in group file contents
    tree view. Common commands are now more easily accessible.</font>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">New option to have sounds auto-play when they
    are selected in the group file contents tree view.</font>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">New option to turn off warning when extracting
    all files from a group file.</font>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Program options dialog box reformatted.</font>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The program view has been enlarged a bit to
    allow for the new names column in the art file information view.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Entering an invalid filename for the external
    palette file would cause the program to crash at bad times (i.e. - when
    saving a group file).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Accelerator keys for playing and stopping
    sounds changed from [P] and [S] to [ALT]+[P] and [ALT]+[S] respectively.
    This prevents the &quot;cannot rename file&quot; bug that was associated
    with the letters P and S.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Removed the read-only box from several of the
    open file dialog boxes, making them slightly smaller. Also fixed a typo in
    the file filter drop down menu in one of the open file dialogs.</font></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p align="center"><u><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">Version 3.0</font></strong></u></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">New or Updated Features</font></strong> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Group file creation support implemented. Now
    you can create your own group files from scratch!</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Added support for inserting files into an existing group
    file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Added support for permanently removing files from an existing
    group file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Code for handling group files as a whole
    rewritten (some things should be more efficient now).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Progress meter now indicates progress
    for more than just file extraction (now used for saving group files).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Support added for playing music (*.mid) files
    directly from the group file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">New options button on toolbar (for quick
    options dialog access).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Minor cosmetic changes to some toolbar
    buttons.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Successful extraction report no longer reports
    the size extracted (it just indicates that the extraction was successful).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Status bar code completely rewritten (things
    should look a lot better now).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Major changes to the about dialog box.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Artwork view port now cleared properly
    when loading a new group file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Several large memory leaks fixed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Code for loading help file now looks in the
    correct place.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">F1 key now functions properly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Main program window now sizes properly, the
    way it should have in the first place. Consequently, the window size and
    window status is no longer saved to the registry.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Main window is no longer sizeable and cannot
    be maximized.</font></li>
</ul>

<p align="center"><u><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">Version 2.0</font></strong></u></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">New or Updated Features</font></strong> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Support for viewing tiles in embedded art files
    (*.art) has been added.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">External palette files are now supported.
    Embedded palette files are given preference over external palette files;
    there is no way for the user to change this. I have included external
    palette file support to allow the user to view artwork in group files that
    do not include a palette file. The default palette file resides in the
    program directory (after the program is properly installed).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Support has been added for playing and stopping
    *.voc files (sound files) directly from the group file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Selected file or filetype information moved down into the
    status bar.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Tree view now always shows the selected item
    (even when it doesn't have the focus).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Program error listing has been removed (was
    somewhat pointless).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The term &quot;Release x.x&quot; has been changed to
    &quot;Version x.x&quot; (a little nicer IMO).</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The &quot;total group file size&quot; static in the status bar now agrees with the total
    bytes extracted when all embedded files are extracted. These two values were different
    before, and should not have been.</font></li>
  <li><font
    face="Arial" size="2"> Successful extraction report (in the status bar) now appears *after* the
    files are successfully extracted, not as soon as the extract files button is pressed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The art info list now clears properly when no
    art file is currently selected in the tree view.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">If the default directory option was turned off, and the cancel
    button was pressed on the extraction directory box, an error box would appear (and it
    should not have appeared in the first place). This is now fixed.</font></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p align="center"><u><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">Version 1.3</font></strong></u></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">New or Updated Features</font></strong> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Command for extracting all files is now available.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">File extraction code has been heavily rewritten (things should
    be much smoother now). If the default directory is provided in the program options dialog,
    extracted files will simply be placed in the default directory (without a &quot;select
    destination&quot; dialog appearing on screen). If a default directory is not selected, the
    &quot;select destination&quot; dialogs will appear when you wish to extract files.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Successful extraction dialog removed (as well as the option to
    enable or disable this). Successful extractions now are indicated by means of the status
    bar.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Total number of files and total size of group file now appear
    in the status bar.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Art file animation types now appear as their respective names
    (forward, backward, oscillate, or none) instead of the cryptic numbering system previously
    used.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">New option to either enable or disable the loading of art file
    information when a art file is selected (default is enabled).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Program layout heavily changed to make the workspace smaller.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Help files completely rewritten.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Updated the program icon.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The open files dialog now begins browsing in the default
    directory if one is provided (in the program options dialog).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Art file information box now supports full row selection. It
    also is properly cleared when a second group file is opened.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Art file information box no longer disappears when information
    is updating.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">File viewing options menu command removed from the Tools menu
    (I wasn't using it anyways).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Upon opening a second group file (with a first group file
    already open), the selected filetype fields were not cleared properly. They are now
    cleared as they should have been.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The keyboard indicators in the status bar (for Caps Lock,
    Scroll Lock, and Insert) have been removed.</font></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"><u><strong>Version 1.2</strong></u></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>New or Updated Features</strong></font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Art file information support added. Now you can view the
    number of tiles, the size of each tile, and the animation settings for each art file.
    Viewing the art itself has not yet been added.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">2 new accelerator keys (F5 and F6).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Previously removed accelerator keys replaced.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The &quot;number of files selected&quot; information box now
    always shows the number of files in the current filetype. In previous releases this box
    would show &quot;1&quot; if only one file was selected - and that was a waste of space in
    my opinion.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Main layout of program slightly changed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Help index changed a little.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Package now in an InstallShield installation program.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Program option code completely rewritten. In previous
    versions, pressing the cancel button in the program options dialog box would write the
    option settings (something that it should not have done). Options were also being read and
    written at the wrong time and caused problems in some other areas of the program. This
    code has been overhauled and now works correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Program now reads into a 128K buffer (it was 64K). I'm still
    experimenting with this value, but it will probably remain at 128K in future releases.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Several memory leaks have been &quot;sealed up&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Pressing the &quot;Cancel&quot; button on the overwrite files
    dialog (when extracting a filetype) would bring up the &quot;File extraction
    complete&quot; dialog, indicating that the extraction was successful. This now works
    properly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The extraction progress bar now clears itself properly (after
    a successful extraction).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Window sizing problem fixed. The scroll bars would sometimes
    appear on screen, even when the window was still large enough to view everything in the
    workspace. This problem has been fixed.</font></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p align="center"><u><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">Version 1.1</font></strong></u></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">New or Updated Features</font></strong> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Added the extraction success dialog and an option for turning
    this dialog off.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Slightly updated the look and feel of the program (now size
    and number of files shown in the same boxes, whether a filetype or file is selected).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Updated the about box significantly.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Program now reads into a 64K buffer (it was 16K) - Extraction
    should be somewhat faster now</font></li>
</ul>

<hr>
